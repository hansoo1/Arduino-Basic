# Arduino-Basic with UNITY

Simple example made by Arduino & UNITY 

# Practice : Making a robot that can surprise parents in daily life

# Step1. Conceptual design

1. Basic Function
- Surprise event for parents

2. Main Requirement
- Confess that you love your parents often
- gift a smile
- Recognize the parents' basic situation

3. How to design
- make to think of famliy (like a child's face)
- Use 3D printer

# Step2. Working Princple

- Sub Function 1) The design which reminds you of family (made by 3D Printer)
- Sub Function 2) One-way communication using LCD module
- Sub Function 3) motion detection using ultrasonic sensor
- Sub Function 4) Check the condition of the house using a temperature sensor

# Step3. Make Arduino_circuit

#Components
- Arduino (ATMEGA32P)
- HC-SR04 (ultrasonic sensor)
- LM35DZ (temperature sensor)
- LCD 16x2 4pin(I2C control)
- Here is sample code. According to operation and circuit diagram, you have to modify code!

# Step4. Make a robot!!

# Step5. Metaverse (Real world + virtual world)
- Connect Unity and Arduino through serial communication.
